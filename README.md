# Country and Map

This is a demo project for using APIs. This project was made using Vanilla JavaScript and the styling using CSS Flexbox.

In this project you can enter a counrty name in the text field. When you click the submit button, a section with some basic information and a map section, of the selected counrty, will be displayed to the screen. 

The APIs' used in this project are:
1. The https://restcountries.eu/ for displaying some basic info for the selected country.
2. The https://openlayers.org/ for displaying the location of the selected counrty on the map.
